            <!-- <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30hGFx8n36Y"></iframe>, the problem was that I was not able to play on my local files, but when I uploaded it to "folk" it worked.-->

            <p>
                This is me playing drums on a song called <q>Critical Acclaim</q> by the band Avenged Sevenfold. I shot
                this video back in 2016, so I was about 16 years of age. This was not my first try, however, it was my
                first try with microphones instead of an audio recorder which I used earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I did not continue this <q>profession</q> as it was very time consuming. I still play the
                drums, but I do not make videoes anymore, maybe I will continue later when and if I get the time for it.

                So, I have done a little bit of photoshop throughout the years, and this picture is one of the first I
                did. Of course, it is not something serious. This was something me and some friends did in High School
                when we were bored.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Earlier this year, back in the town where I'm from, there was a show in which i was an actor. In
                norwegian it's called <q>revy</q>, which roughly translates to <q>review</q>. The picture displays my
                role as a female cleaning personnel at a police station in Modum.
