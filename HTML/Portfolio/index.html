				<p>Hi, my name is Glenn Eirik Hansen, and I study <abbr title="Bachelor in Webdevelopment">BWU</abbr> .
					Very briefly about me,
					I was born the 14<sup>th</sup> of August 1999.
					From a very young age, I got an interest for airplanes. Therefore, I have a dream of becoming a
					pilot. Why are you studying webdevelopment then, you may wonder?
					Well, simply because becoming a pilot, or getting a job as a pilot is very hard, therefore I'm
					studying this so I have a backup-plan in case I'm not getting a job as a pilot later.

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>Throughout my childhood and teenage years, I've had a <strong id="upper">lot</strong> of hobbies.
			I have been a very active kid, didn't spend too much time at home in my younger years,
			probably because I did not have a computer yet. As I grew older, I got my first desktop computer, and I
			started to play more and more games.
			However, it did not stop me from doing my hobby at the time, which was handball. All of the hobbies I have
			had or currently have, is as follows:

		</p>

		<div class="hobby">
			<div class="hleft">
				<ul>
					<li>Swimming</li>
					<li>Football</li>
					<li>Track and Field</li>
					<li>Motocross Trial</li>
					<li>Biathlon</li>
					<li>Hockey</li>
					<li>Handball</li>
					<li>Music
						<ul>
							<li>Currently active, mainly play drums, but can also play guitar, bass, piano and sing</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Competitive Shooting, IPSC
						<!--So apparently I get a W3C Validator error with the nested lists, so I put the ul element inside the li element-->
						<ul>
							<li>Currently active, see clip on the right</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>
			I like music a lot, <i>since I play a couple of instruments myself as I mentioned above,</i>
			and my biggest influence in music taste and the reason that I play drums is <ins>Rammstein</ins>.
			I started listening to Rammstein when I was <del>5</del>, no 3, so back in 2003/2004, and that's why I
			like a lot of metal or heavy music. So I could start listing all the songs I like, but that would take a
			long time, so instead I'm listing the bands I listen the most to.
		</p>
		<div class="music">
			<div class="mleft">
				<ol>
					<li>Rammstein</li>
					<li>Avenged Sevenfold</li>
