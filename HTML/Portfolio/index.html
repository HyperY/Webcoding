        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <p>Home page: This is the first page users will see. Here, you can include as
            many relevant information as you want to but, at least, it must contain:
            An image and a description about you. The description must use
            different semantic tags.
            Cite your favourite book, essay, poem, song, painting or
            creative work in general.
            Quote a small snippet from the chosen creative work (text).
            A list of hobbies.
            (*) Anything else you want to remark (remember, this is the first
            page users will read and therefore you must hook them, so they feel
            they want to read more about you).</p>
